## User Stories

### 1. As a player, I want to launch the UE4 game from the launcher so I can play the main game easily.
### 2. As a player, I want to launch the web-based game from the launcher so I can access the 2D SPA game quickly.
### 3. As a player, I want to see the latest news and updates about the game in the launcher so I stay informed.
### 4. As a player, I want the launcher to notify me about new patches or updates for the UE4 game so I can keep my game up to date.
### 5. As a developer, I want the backend to serve news and update information via an API so the launcher and web game can display it.
### 6. As a developer, I want the codebase to be modular so that features can be added or updated independently.
### 7. As a developer, I want to track design decisions, code changes, and troubleshooting steps for future reference and maintainability.

## Developer Notes
- You can start both backend and launcher-app together with `npm start` from the project root (requires `concurrently`).
